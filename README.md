# asyncPool

## Why?

Existing solutions also re-implement Promise ðŸ˜©...

The goal of this library is to use native async functions (if ES7 is available) and/or native Promise (ES6) including `Promise.race()` and `Promise.all()` to implement the concurrency and error retry behavior (look our source code).

## What?

`asyncPool` runs multiple promise-returning & async functions in a limited concurrency pool. It rejects immediately as soon as one of the promises rejects,If a retry is required, it will start immediately until the retrylimit is reached. If it fails in the end, the promise will be rejected. It resolves when all the promises completes. It calls the iterator function as soon as possible (under concurrency limit). For example:

```js
function test() {
    let count = 0
    asyncPool(
        2,
        [1000, 5000, 3000, 2000],
        function (item, array) {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    if (item == 1000) {
                        count++
                        if (count === 2) {
                            resolve(item)
                        } else {
                            reject(item)
                        }
                    } else {
                        resolve(item)
                    }
                }, item)
            })
        },
        1
    )
        .then((r) => console.log(r))
        .catch((error) => console.log(error))
}
test();
// Call iterator (i = 1000)
// Call iterator (i = 5000)
// Pool limit of 2 reached, wait for the quicker one to complete...
// 1000 finishes PromiseÂ {<rejected>: 1000}
// Try again,call iterator (i = 1000)
// 1000 finishes PromiseÂ {<resolved>: 1000}
// Call iterator (i = 3000)
// Pool limit of 2 reached, wait for the quicker one to complete...
// 5000 finishes
// Call iterator (i = 2000)
// 3000 finishes
// 2000 finishes
// Resolves, results are passed in given array order `[1000, 5000, 3000, 2000]`.
```

## Usage

```
$ npm install tiny-async-pool
```

```js
import asyncPool from "tiny-async-pool";
```

### ES7 async

```js
const timeout = i => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(i), i));
const results = await asyncPool(2, [1000, 5000, 3000, 2000], timeout);
```

Note: Something really nice will be possible soon https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration

### ES6 Promise

```js
const timeout = i => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(i), i));
return asyncPool(2, [1000, 5000, 3000, 2000], timeout).then(results => {
  ...
});
```

## API

### `asyncPool(poolLimit, array, iteratorFn)`

Runs multiple promise-returning & async functions in a limited concurrency pool. It rejects immediately as soon as one of the promises rejects. It resolves when all the promises completes. It calls the iterator function as soon as possible (under concurrency limit).

#### poolLimit

The pool limit number (>= 1).

#### array

Input array.

#### iteratorFn

Iterator function that takes two arguments (array item and the array itself). The iterator function should either return a promise or be an async function.
